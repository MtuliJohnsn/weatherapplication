Design of weather Application.
Allow user to  input a city name and retrieve the current weather information for that city.
The application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the weather data and displays it on a webpage. The design is based on a client server architecture, where the server is built using the Node.js  framework (server.js)and the client is built using HTML , CSS, and JavaScript. 
The application is designed to handle errors and provide feedback to the user in case of any issues.


I used CSS code that styles an HTML page with a background image  from website and various elements. It sets the font family and style for the body, adds a background image to the HTML, and styles input fields and buttons. 
The "card" class  used to create a container with a flex layout and background color. The content of the card is aligned using flex properties, and text elements are styled with font weight and text-transform properties.

Finally after getting required output ,  i deployed it to a hosting service Heroku by creating a new Heroku app called weather0 , connecting it to a GitHub repository, and configuring the app's environment variables. After deployment,The app can be accessed
through its Heroku URL. (https://mighty-coast-37212.herokuapp.com/ )
